Batch Processing :

  -Execution of series of jobs without manual intervention.
  -Batch process performs series of steps for processing an input, these steps are known as jobs.
  
Azure Batch Service :

  -It is managed service that enables us to run high performance paralled computing jobs in cloud.
  -It can be on demand or can be schduled to run at specific time.

Batch Service Workflow : 

  1. Upload your data files to azure storage account, while you run the task batch will download the data files 
      to compute nodes for processing.
  2. Upload the applications for running the task.(script/binary files).
  3. Create compute nodes, specify size and OS (Linux or Windows).
  4. Create job, it will manage the task and assign them to compute nodes for running and processing your data.
  5. Add task to your job.
  6. Monitor the job, as they finish output file get generated in storage account.
  
Below are some resources of batch service :

  1. Batch Account (URL be like https://{account-name}.{region-id}.batch.azure.com)
  2. Batch Rest api
  3. Batch applications
  4. Compute Pool- Collection of compute node where application run (One batch account can have more than one pool.)
  5. Task Virtual machine.
      a. Dedicated nodes.
      b. Low priority nodes.
  6. Tasks
  7. Jobs
